# PoE Reciper

This project aims at creating an easy forkable software that, powered by Github Actions, could bring you the vendor recipes from Path Of Exile that your
character could use.

# Running on local environment

Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill the variables for easy development.

Run the script with a simple `npm start`, provided you've done `npm install` before.

# Running on GitHub Actions

1. Fork the repository (optionally: make it private to avoid others from seeing your stash data)
2. Add all mandatory environment variables (see `.env.sample` file for guidance)
3. Run Github Actions on your repository
